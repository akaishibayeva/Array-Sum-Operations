You have an identity permutation of N integers as an array initially. An identity permutation of N integers is [1,2,...,N-1,N].
In this task, you have to perform M operations on the array and report the sum of the elements of the array after each opertion.

The i^th operation consists of an integer op_i.

If the array contains op_i, swap the first and last elements in the array.
Else, remove the last element of the array and push op_i to the end of the array.

Input Format

The first line contains two space separated integers N and M.
Then, M lines follow denoting the operations op_i.
Constraints

2 <= N, M <= 10^5
1 <= op_i <= 5*10^5

Output Format

Print M lines, each containing a single integer denoting the answer to each of the M operations.
